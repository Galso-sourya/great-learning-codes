greet.foo();
//call
//greet.call();//call calls the calling function!so we can't we directly call the function. what is the use of call? it has advantage. it can change the context.
greet.call('hello');//here context is changed to hello
greet.call('hello','good night','mary');//call and apply has same function but apply can take array as an argument
//apply
var args=['good morning','sourya'];
greet.apply('hello',args);
greet.apply(null,args);
//bind
var greetBound=greet.bind('world');//world is the context here
greetBound('hello','ram');//it will return a function same as greet.in this line, we are actually passing the 2 arguments.here the function name is greetBound only.
var greetHola=greet.bind(null,'hola');
greetHola('david');
